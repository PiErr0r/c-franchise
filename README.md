# C/C++ and maybe C#

## TODO
- [x] 2D n-body simulation
- [x] space shooter game simulation
- [x] blink box (ball inside invisible box and lights a small portion of side on bounce)
- [x] boxed (10 balls in a box without a top, when a ball exits and hits the floor it creates "fireworks")
- [ ] convex hull (3D?) animation (multiple algorithms) [link](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Convex_hull_algorithms#Algorithms)
- [ ] particle simulation (fluid, smoke, fire)
    - [simple fluid simulation](https://prideout.net/blog/old/blog/index.html@p=58.html)
    - [noise based particles I](https://prideout.net/blog/old/blog/index.html@p=63.html)
    - [noise based particles II](https://prideout.net/blog/old/blog/index.html@p=67.html)
    - [deep opacity maps](https://prideout.net/blog/old/blog/index.html@p=69.html)
    - literature/Visualization of smoke using particle systems.pdf
- [ ] maze generation and path-finding (dynamic stuff in maze so we can try D-star)
- [ ] random noise (perlin?)
- [ ] web server (websocket, http...)
